## Wireless Markup Language (WML)

WML (Wireless Markup Language) is used in the Mobile Banking System to create mobile-friendly content. It is an XML-based markup language designed for wireless devices and mobile browsers.

### Reasons to use WML

- WML is designed for wireless devices, requiring less bandwidth and processing power than HTML.
- It ensures longer battery life for mobile devices.
- WML content is suitable for small mobile phone displays.
